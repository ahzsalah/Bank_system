            <p><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> From 5.99% APR</p>
            <p><strong>Term:</strong> 1 to 5 years</p>
            <p>Personal loans can be used for any personal expenses and are not tied to a specific purpose. They are typically unsecured, which means they are not backed by a collateral like a house or car.</p>

            <h2>Car Loan</h2>
            <p><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> From 3.99% APR</p>
            <p><strong>Term:</strong> 1 to 7 years</p>
            <p>Car loans are specifically designed for the purchase of a car. The car serves as collateral for the loan, which often results in a lower interest rate compared to unsecured loans. </p>
